# pandas-ex-2
This project contains some examples of SQL alchemy and pandas to perform Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) jobs.
The end goal is to re-use the maximum amount of ETL code possible. There are already many extensions in both
the sqlalchemy and pandas modules that can:

## pandas
* read and write multiple data types including csv, Excel, cloud providers

## sqlalchemy
* ORM and core SQL engine to handle queries to MS SQL Server, MySQL, Postgres, and SQLite databases
  - also has an in-memory provider thorugh SQLite engine
  
Both modules have active communities and cookbooks of common use cases available.
